# Configuration & Guild Whitelist

Two related subsystems control who the bot serves and how it behaves on each server:

1. **`/config`** — per-guild settings (channels and roles) that every other system reads. Each guild is fully isolated; nothing is shared across servers.
2. **The guild whitelist** — an owner-only allow-list that decides which Discord servers the bot is permitted to join at all. A server not on the list gets a DM approval flow (or, without a usable owner DM, an immediate leave) rather than staying — see [First server](#first-server-no-chicken-and-egg) below.

All per-server setup happens **in Discord** via `/config`, not through environment variables. The operator-level secrets involved here are `OWNER_ID` and (optionally) `ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS` in `.env` (see [Setup](../setup.md)).

---

## 1. `/config` — per-guild configuration

### Permissions

`/config` is built with `setDefaultMemberPermissions(PermissionFlagsBits.Administrator)`, so Discord hides it from non-admins in the slash-command picker. `execute()` **also** re-checks `interaction.member.permissions.has(PermissionFlagsBits.Administrator)` and rejects non-admins with `🚫 Only administrators can use this command.`. Both gates are guild Administrator — there is no owner requirement for `/config`. All replies are ephemeral.

### Subcommands

| Subcommand             | Purpose                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `show`                 | Show the current configuration for this server, grouped into Tickets / Verification / Voice, plus a setup-warnings or all-good footer. |
| `quick-setup`          | Guided one-shot setup that writes every field at once.                                                                                 |
| `set-ticket-log`       | Set the ticket log channel.                                                                                                            |
| `set-transcript-log`   | Set the transcript channel (optional; if unset, transcripts are disabled).                                                             |
| `set-owner-role`       | Set the ticket "Owner" contact role.                                                                                                   |
| `set-twitch-mod-role`  | Set the ticket "Twitch Mod" contact role.                                                                                              |
| `set-discord-mod-role` | Set the ticket "Discord Mod" contact role.                                                                                             |
| `set-verified-role`    | Set the role granted on successful verification.                                                                                       |
| `set-verify-log`       | Set the verification log channel.                                                                                                      |
| `set-join-vc`          | Set the Join-to-Create voice channel (must be a voice channel).                                                                        |
| `set-vc-category`      | Set the category where temporary VCs are created (must be a category).                                                                 |

The nine `set-*` subcommands are generated from a single `SET_FIELDS` table in `commands/config.js`; both the command builder and the dispatch read from it, so adding a configurable field is a one-line change. `show` and `quick-setup` are bespoke because they touch every field at once.

### `quick-setup` options

`quick-setup` is the fastest way to configure a fresh server. Two options are **required**; the rest are optional.

| Option             | Required | Writes to key                                |
| ------------------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `ticket_log`       | ✅       | `ticketLogChannelId`                         |
| `verified_role`    | ✅       | `verifiedRoleId`                             |
| `transcript_log`   | —        | `transcriptChannelId`                        |
| `owner_role`       | —        | `ticketOwnerRoleId`                          |
| `twitch_mod_role`  | —        | `ticketTwitchModRoleId`                      |
| `discord_mod_role` | —        | `ticketDiscordModRoleId`                     |
| `verify_log`       | —        | `verifyLogChannelId`                         |
| `join_vc`          | —        | `joinToCreateVcId` (must be a voice channel) |
| `vc_category`      | —        | `vcCategoryId` (must be a category)          |

Omitted optional options are written as `null` (i.e. `quick-setup` clears any previously-set value for the fields it does not receive). Use the individual `set-*` subcommands afterward to fill in or change one field at a time without touching the others.

Channel-type validation: `join_vc` must be a voice channel and `vc_category` must be a category, both in `quick-setup` and in `set-join-vc` / `set-vc-category`; a wrong type is rejected before anything is saved.

### Config keys and which system reads them

`/config` persists these keys per guild. The right-hand columns show which system consumes each key and how a system reads it (via the helper accessors in `systems/guildConfig.js`).

| Config key               | Set by                                | Read by                                                                                                  | Notes / fallback                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `ticketLogChannelId`     | `set-ticket-log`, `quick-setup`       | Tickets (`getTicketConfig` → `logChannelId`), Verification (`getVerifyConfig` → `logChannelId` fallback) | Ticket log. Also used as the verification log fallback when `verifyLogChannelId` is unset.                                                                      |
| `transcriptChannelId`    | `set-transcript-log`, `quick-setup`   | Tickets (`getTicketConfig` → `transcriptChannelId`, and `logChannelId` fallback)                         | Where full transcripts go. **No fallback to the log channel** — if unset, transcripts are skipped so a private conversation never lands in a general staff-log. |
| `ticketOwnerRoleId`      | `set-owner-role`, `quick-setup`       | Tickets (`getTicketConfig` → `ownerRoleId`)                                                              | Role pinged for "Contact Owner" tickets.                                                                                                                        |
| `ticketTwitchModRoleId`  | `set-twitch-mod-role`, `quick-setup`  | Tickets (`getTicketConfig` → `twitchModRoleId`)                                                          | Role pinged for "Contact Twitch Mod" tickets.                                                                                                                   |
| `ticketDiscordModRoleId` | `set-discord-mod-role`, `quick-setup` | Tickets (`getTicketConfig` → `discordModRoleId`)                                                         | Role pinged for "Contact Discord Mod" tickets.                                                                                                                  |
| `verifiedRoleId`         | `set-verified-role`, `quick-setup`    | Verification (`getVerifyConfig` → `verifiedRoleId`)                                                      | Role granted on successful verification.                                                                                                                        |
| `verifyLogChannelId`     | `set-verify-log`, `quick-setup`       | Verification (`getVerifyConfig` → `logChannelId`)                                                        | Verification log. Falls back to `ticketLogChannelId` if unset.                                                                                                  |
| `joinToCreateVcId`       | `set-join-vc`, `quick-setup`          | Temporary VCs (`getVcConfig` → `joinToCreateVcId`)                                                       | The "Join-to-Create" voice channel.                                                                                                                             |
| `vcCategoryId`           | `set-vc-category`, `quick-setup`      | Temporary VCs (`getVcConfig` → `vcCategoryId`)                                                           | Category where temp VCs are created.                                                                                                                            |

See [Tickets](./tickets.md), [Verification](./verification.md), and [Temporary Voice Channels](./temp-voice.md) for how each system uses these values.

### Setup warnings (`getConfigStatus`)

`show` and `quick-setup` both run a health check (`getConfigStatus` in `systems/guildConfig.js`) and append the results. A guild is flagged when:

- `ticketLogChannelId` is not set → "Ticket log channel is not set."
- `verifiedRoleId` is not set → "Verified role is not set."
- `joinToCreateVcId` is not set → "Join-to-Create VC is not set."
- `vcCategoryId` is not set → "VC category is not set."
- **none** of `ticketOwnerRoleId` / `ticketTwitchModRoleId` / `ticketDiscordModRoleId` is set → "No ticket contact roles are configured."

If the list is empty it shows "Everything essential looks configured!". These are advisory only; unconfigured systems simply stay inactive for that guild.

### The config store (`guildConfig.js` on `store.js`)

Per-guild config lives in a single JSON file, `config/guild-config.json`, managed by `systems/guildConfig.js` (built on the shared `systems/store.js` key/value store).

- The file is keyed by guild ID. Each guild's value is an object with all nine keys above (any unset key is `null`).
- `getGuildConfig(guildId)` lazily creates a fully-null entry for a guild the first time it's read (`ensureGuild`), so missing guilds never throw.
- `updateGuildConfig(guildId, patch)` shallow-merges a patch and saves.
- The store (`createJsonStore`) loads the whole file into memory once at startup and writes back **atomically** (temp file + rename via `writeJsonAtomic`) on every mutation, so a crash mid-write cannot corrupt the file. A non-object root (array/primitive) is treated as empty `{}`.

The runtime file is gitignored. A template ships as `config/guild-config.example.json` (contents: `{}`). On first run the bot creates entries on demand, so you can start from the empty template — you do not need to hand-edit it.

---

## 2. Guild whitelist (owner-only)

The whitelist decides which Discord servers the bot will operate in. It is enforced both reactively (when the bot is invited) and through owner commands.

### Source of truth (`whitelist.js`)

`systems/whitelist.js` owns the allow-list: a JSON **array of guild-ID strings** in `config/allowed-guilds.json`. It keeps one in-memory array that `index.js`, `/add`, and `/removeguild` all share, so every read and write agrees within the single bot process. (Previously each read the file independently, which let an add-then-remove in the same process resurrect or drop entries.)

| Function             | Behavior                                                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `isAllowed(guildId)` | True if the (stringified) ID is in the list.                              |
| `add(guildId)`       | Adds an ID; returns `false` if already present. Persists atomically.      |
| `remove(guildId)`    | Removes an ID; returns `false` if it wasn't present. Persists atomically. |
| `list()`             | Returns a snapshot copy of the current IDs.                               |
| `reload()`           | Re-reads the file from disk (e.g. after editing it out of band).          |

IDs are de-duped and normalized to strings on load; a missing file (`ENOENT`) or a non-array file is treated as an empty list. Like the config store, writes are atomic.

The runtime file is gitignored. A template ships as `config/allowed-guilds.example.json` (contents: `[]`). You can either pre-seed it (or `.env`, see below) before first run, or add guilds at runtime with `/add guild` once the bot is already in at least one allowed server.

### First server (no chicken-and-egg)

Two ways to allow your first server before `/add` is usable:

1. **`.env` seed** — set `ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS=<your guild id>` before starting the
   bot; ids are merged into the allow-list at boot.
2. **DM approval** — just invite the bot. Joining a non-allowed server now DMs
   the owner (`OWNER_ID`) an approval card with **Approve** / **Leave** buttons
   instead of instantly leaving. No decision within 24 hours = the bot leaves.
   A startup sweep re-checks every current server, so restarts or missed DMs
   can't strand anything. If the DM cannot be delivered at all (closed DMs),
   the bot falls back to leaving immediately and logs a hint.

### Auto-leave / DM approval on join (`guildCreate` in `index.js`, `systems/guildApproval.js`)

When the bot is added to any server, the `guildCreate` handler checks `whitelist.isAllowed(guild.id)`:

- **Allowed** → it logs `Joined allowed guild …` and stays.
- **Not allowed** → it calls `guildApproval.requestApproval(client, guild)` (see below) instead of leaving immediately.

#### `requestApproval` (DM approval flow)

- If `OWNER_ID` is unset, there is nobody to DM: the bot logs a warning (with a tip to set `ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS`) and leaves immediately — same as the old behaviour.
- Otherwise it DMs the owner an embed (`🛡️ New server wants the bot`, with the guild's name/ID/member count) and two buttons: `wl_approve:<guildId>` and `wl_deny:<guildId>` (customId prefix `wl_`, routed by `handleWhitelistInteraction`).
  - **Approve** adds the guild to the allow-list and clears the pending timer.
  - **Leave** (only if the guild isn't already allowed — guards a stale duplicate card) leaves the guild and clears the pending timer.
  - **No response within 24 hours** (`PENDING_TIMEOUT_MS`) → the bot leaves automatically if the guild still isn't allowed.
- If the DM can't be delivered at all (e.g. the owner has DMs closed to the bot), the bot falls back to leaving immediately, same as the no-`OWNER_ID` case.
- Pending state is **in-memory only** (a `Map<guildId, Timeout>`) — it is not persisted. A `GuildDelete` event clears any pending timer for that guild, so if the bot is re-invited later it gets a fresh approval card and a full 24-hour window rather than inheriting stale state.
- On `ClientReady`, `guildApproval.sweepUnapproved(client)` re-checks every guild the bot is currently in and re-requests approval for anything not allowed — this catches guilds that joined (or whose DM was missed) while the bot was offline, since pending state doesn't survive a restart.

So with both mechanisms, a guild never needs to be pre-approved before inviting the bot — either seed `ALLOWED_GUILD_IDS` ahead of time, or just invite it and approve the DM.

### `/add guild` — allow a guild ID

```
/add guild id:<guild ID>
```

Adds a guild ID to the allow-list. The `id` option is validated against a basic snowflake pattern (`^\d{10,25}$`); a malformed value is rejected with a warning. If the ID is already present you get an informational "already in the allowed list" reply; otherwise it confirms the add and notes that new invites to that guild will be accepted.

> The command is named `/add` with a single `guild` subcommand (its top-level description is "Owner-only tools").

### `/removeguild` — remove a guild ID and leave

```
/removeguild guild_id:<guild ID>
```

Removes a guild ID from the allow-list. If the bot is **currently in** that guild (`client.guilds.cache`), it then calls `targetGuild.leave()` and reports whether the leave succeeded. Removing an ID that wasn't on the list returns an informational reply and does nothing else.

### Owner gate (`isOwner` + `setDefaultMemberPermissions`)

Both `/add` and `/removeguild` use **two** layers of protection:

1. **Discord-side visibility:** `setDefaultMemberPermissions('0')` — no default permissions, so the commands are hidden from everyone except server admins in the slash picker. This is _only_ a UI filter.
2. **The real gate — `isOwner`:** `execute()` calls `isOwner(interaction.user.id)` (from `systems/permissions.js`) and returns the standard ephemeral denial (`⚠️ You are not allowed to use this command.`) if it fails.

`isOwner` compares the caller's ID against `OWNER_ID` from the environment (`process.env.OWNER_ID`, trimmed):

```js
function isOwner(userId) {
  const owner = getOwnerId();
  return owner !== '' && String(userId) === owner;
}
```

**Important:** if `OWNER_ID` is **unset or blank**, `getOwnerId()` returns `''` and `isOwner` returns `false` for _everyone_ — there is no fallback owner. In that state nobody can run `/add` or `/removeguild`, and the whitelist can only be changed by editing `config/allowed-guilds.json` directly (followed by a restart, or `whitelist.reload()`). Always set `OWNER_ID` in `.env`. See [Setup](../setup.md) for the env vars.

Because the Discord-side gate is admin-only and the authoritative gate is `isOwner`, the bot owner must also be a guild administrator wherever they run these commands.
